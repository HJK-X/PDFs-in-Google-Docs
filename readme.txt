Note: This is the code copied from the Apps Script editor, which means that this repository can't be run out of the box.
You would need to create a new script add-on for Google Docs, and then copy the code into the file system there.

Currently waiting for a response for the public store listing on the Google Workspace Marketplace, but once it is posted,
a link will be added here so that you can install it for yourself.
